        The job market is undergoing a transformation, driven by the entry of Generation Z — those born between 1997 and 2012. As the first fully digital-native generation, Gen Z brings new expectations, values, and work habits that are reshaping hiring practices and workplace cultures. To stay competitive, recruiters must understand these shifts and adapt accordingly. Here are the key trends defining how Gen Z is redefining the job market.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">1. Digital-First Approach to Job Searching</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">Gen Z job seekers rely heavily on digital platforms when searching for jobs. Traditional job boards are being supplemented — or even replaced — by LinkedIn, TikTok, and other social media platforms. Companies must enhance their online presence, leveraging engaging content, video job postings, and direct messaging strategies to attract young talent.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">2. Preference for Work-Life Balance and Flexibility</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">Unlike previous generations, Gen Z prioritizes work-life balance over traditional job perks. They value remote work options, flexible schedules, and mental health support. Organizations that fail to provide these benefits may struggle to attract and retain Gen Z employees.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">3. Demand for Purpose-Driven Work</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">Gen Z is passionate about making an impact. They seek employers with strong corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, sustainability efforts, and ethical business practices. Companies that emphasize their mission and values will have an edge in attracting top Gen Z talent.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">4. Desire for Continuous Learning and Growth</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">Career development is a key priority for Gen Z. They are eager for upskilling opportunities, mentorship programs, and clear pathways for advancement. Employers that invest in professional development will have a stronger appeal to this growth-oriented generation.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">5. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Are Non-Negotiable</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">Gen Z is the most diverse generation yet, and they expect workplaces to reflect and uphold diversity, equity, and inclusion. They are more likely to engage with companies that demonstrate genuine commitments to DEI through policies, leadership representation, and inclusive company culture.</p>

      <div className="bg-synapse-lighter/30 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4">6. Tech-Savviness and Expectation for Innovation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Having grown up with technology, Gen Z expects workplaces to be tech-forward. They favor companies that adopt modern digital tools, automation, and AI-driven solutions to streamline workflows. Recruiters should optimize hiring processes with digital-first strategies, including virtual interviews and AI-driven assessments.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4">7. Transparent and Authentic Employer Branding</h2>
        <p>Gen Z values authenticity and transparency in employer branding. They are likely to research a company's reputation on platforms like Glassdoor, and they prefer workplaces with open communication and honest leadership. Companies should prioritize transparent job descriptions, real employee testimonials, and candid insights into company culture.</p>
