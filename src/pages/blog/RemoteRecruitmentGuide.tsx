      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">Benefits of Remote Recruitment</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">1. Access to a Global Talent Pool</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">One of the most significant advantages of remote recruitment is the ability to source candidates from a global talent pool. Organizations are no longer restricted by geographical limitations, allowing them to find high-quality candidates at competitive rates and access specialized skill sets that may not be available locally.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">2. Increased Scalability and Flexibility</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Remote recruitment allows businesses to scale their hiring efforts efficiently. With automation tools, HR teams can streamline applicant screening, interview scheduling, and communication, enabling them to focus on evaluating the most suitable candidates. This flexibility ensures that organizations can quickly adapt to evolving workforce needs.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">3. Significant Cost Savings</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">By eliminating expenses associated with physical office space, commuting, and relocation, remote hiring significantly reduces operational costs. Companies can reallocate these savings to other strategic initiatives, such as employee development and technology investments.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">4. Enhanced Hiring Efficiency</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">A well-structured remote recruitment process shortens the hiring cycle, allowing organizations to onboard qualified candidates faster. By leveraging AI-powered applicant tracking systems and structured interview processes, hiring managers can make data-driven decisions, improving overall hiring efficiency.</p>
