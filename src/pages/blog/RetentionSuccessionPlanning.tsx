This involves identifying critical roles within the organization and recognizing high-potential employees who can fill these positions in the future. A well-defined process helps ensure continuity and minimizes disruption during leadership transitions.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">2. Invest in Employee Development</h3>

This not only enhances their skills but also fosters a sense of loyalty and commitment to the organization.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">3. Create Individual Development Plans (IDPs)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Tailoring development activities to individual employees through IDPs can bridge skill gaps and align their career aspirations with organizational goals. These plans may include training programs, job rotations, and other developmental activities designed to prepare individuals for key positions.</p>
