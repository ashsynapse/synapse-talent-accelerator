        As we step into 2025, the hiring landscape is undergoing significant transformations, influenced by technological advancements, changing workforce demographics, and evolving candidate expectations. Here are the key trends shaping global hiring practices this year.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">1. Skills-Based Hiring</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The shift towards skills-based hiring is one of the most notable trends. Companies are increasingly focusing on candidates' abilities and potential rather than traditional metrics like resumes and past job titles. This approach allows organizations to tap into a broader talent pool, including nontraditional candidates who may possess the skills necessary for success but lack conventional qualifications.</p>
      <p className="mb-6">Research indicates that by 2030, there could be a global talent shortage of 85 million workers, making this trend crucial for maintaining productivity across industries.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">2. Emphasis on Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Diversity and inclusion (D&I) have moved from being mere buzzwords to essential components of successful hiring strategies. Organizations that prioritize D&I are statistically more likely to outperform their competitors.</p>
      <div className="bg-synapse-lighter/30 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <p className="mb-3">Companies are adopting several strategies:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Using AI tools to eliminate bias in job descriptions</li>
          <li>Establishing diverse interview panels to foster an inclusive hiring process</li>
          <li>Focusing on genuine inclusion that enhances team performance and innovation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">3. Hybrid Work Environments</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The hybrid work model continues to gain traction as employees seek flexibility in their work arrangements. Surveys show that a significant percentage of job seekers prefer hybrid or fully remote positions over traditional in-office roles.</p>
      <p className="mb-6">Companies offering flexible work options will have a competitive edge in attracting top talent, as this model supports both productivity and employee satisfaction.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">4. Continuous Learning and Upskilling</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">With rapid technological advancements, continuous learning has become imperative. Organizations are investing in upskilling and reskilling their employees to keep pace with changes in the market. This includes:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Creating internal learning academies</li>
        <li>Offering micro-credentials to recognize new competencies</li>
        <li>Developing comprehensive professional development programs</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">Such initiatives not only enhance employee retention but also ensure that the workforce remains competitive in an evolving job landscape.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">5. AI-Driven Recruitment</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into recruitment processes. From automating initial screenings to analyzing candidate data for better decision-making, AI tools are enhancing efficiency and accuracy in hiring.</p>
      <p className="mb-6">This trend reflects a broader move towards data-driven recruitment strategies that help organizations identify high-potential candidates more effectively.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">6. Global Talent Sourcing</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The rise of remote work has expanded the talent pool beyond geographical boundaries. Companies are now sourcing candidates globally, allowing them to find the best talent regardless of location.</p>
      <p className="mb-6">This trend not only increases diversity but also helps organizations adapt to varying market conditions across different regions.</p>
