        To be effective in sourcing roles (and not just plainly sourcing), you need to go beyond traditional search and screening. The goal is to actively engage and attract high-quality candidates while building long-term relationships.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Here's how to move from simple sourcing to effective, strategic sourcing:
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">1. Start with a Targeted Search</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Define Ideal Candidate Profiles</strong>: Collaborate with account managers to identify the exact skills, experience, and attributes needed. This allows for precise targeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Map Talent Pools</strong>: Identify where the best candidates are — specific companies, industries, or even regions. For example, you might focus on competitors or companies known for their engineering prowess.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Personas</strong>: Develop candidate personas based on what motivates these professionals, such as career growth, new technologies, or work-life balance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">2. Focus on Quality, Not Quantity</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Smart Filters</strong>: Use advanced filters and Boolean searches to find a highly focused set of candidates that truly match your needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Dives into Profiles</strong>: Rather than mass-sourcing from LinkedIn or job boards, take the time to research candidates' work, side projects, and interests</li>
        <li><strong>Qualify Candidates Proactively</strong>: Understand what a high-quality candidate looks like for your role and industry, and qualify them early by assessing their work and potential fit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">3. Create a Personalized Candidate Experience</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Tailor Your Messaging</strong>: Customize your outreach to each candidate. Mention specific aspects of their work, interests, or professional achievements. The more personal your message, the higher the likelihood of engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight What Matters to Them</strong>: Understand the motivations of tech talent. For instance, mention exciting projects, challenging problems to solve, learning opportunities, or cutting-edge technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage on Their Preferred Channels</strong>: Don't limit yourself to LinkedIn. Reach out via GitHub, Twitter, or even email, using each platform's appropriate tone and content style.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">4. Leverage Data and Analytics</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Track Key Metrics</strong>: Use data to measure the effectiveness of your sourcing strategy. Track response rates, time-to-fill, cost-per-hire, and the success rate of different outreach approaches.</li>
        <li><strong>A/B Testing</strong>: Continuously optimize your outreach strategies by testing different messages, subject lines, platforms, or even job titles to see what resonates with your target audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage Talent Market Insights</strong>: Analyze talent supply and demand in your region, salary benchmarks, and competitive hiring trends. This helps you position your role more effectively.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">5. Build Long-Term Relationships</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Create Talent Pipelines</strong>: Don't just source for immediate roles — build a talent pool of candidates for future needs. Engage with them consistently by sharing relevant content, job updates, and industry trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Nurture Passive Candidates</strong>: Stay in touch with candidates who aren't actively looking but may be open to opportunities in the future. Regularly share updates or invite them to events that align with their interests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">6. Focus on Value Proposition</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Be Candidate-Centric</strong>: Emphasize what sets your company apart, especially in the tech world — whether it's flexible work options, a great tech stack, cutting-edge projects, or a strong developer culture.</li>
        <li><strong>Show Career Progression</strong>: Tech professionals want growth and learning. Make sure your messaging shows how candidates will learn new skills, use advanced tools, or tackle innovative projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight Purpose and Impact</strong>: Many tech professionals are driven by the impact of their work. Highlight how your company or team's work influences real-world outcomes, whether it's through AI, fintech, healthcare, or sustainable tech.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">7. Build Trust and Credibility</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Be Authentic</strong>: Be transparent about the challenges and opportunities of the role. Candidates appreciate honesty and tend to value work that is challenging and meaningful.</li>
      </ul>

        <p className="opacity-90">
