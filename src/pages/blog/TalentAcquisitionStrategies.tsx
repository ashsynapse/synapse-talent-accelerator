      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">Best Practices for Sourcing and Attracting Top Talent</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">1. Develop a Strong Employer Brand</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">A compelling employer brand is essential for attracting top talent. Showcase your company culture, values, and employee testimonials through various channels, including your website and social media. Highlighting diversity, career development opportunities, and work-life balance can make your organization more appealing to potential candidates.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">2. Utilize Social Media for Recruitment</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Social media platforms, especially LinkedIn, are powerful tools for reaching potential candidates. Create engaging content that reflects your company culture and job openings. Regularly share updates about team achievements, industry insights, and employee stories to build a community around your brand.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">3. Implement a Skills-Based Hiring Approach</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Focus on candidates' skills rather than their educational backgrounds or previous job titles. This approach opens up opportunities to attract diverse talent pools who may have gained valuable experience through non-traditional paths. Clearly outline the skills required for each position in your job postings to attract the right candidates.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">4. Foster Employee Referrals</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">Encourage current employees to refer qualified candidates by implementing an employee referral program. Offering incentives for successful hires can motivate employees to tap into their networks, often leading to high-quality candidates who are a good cultural fit.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-synapse-dark mb-4 mt-8">Using AI and Data Analytics in Recruitment</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">1. Automate Routine Tasks with AI</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">AI can streamline many aspects of the recruitment process, from resume screening to interview scheduling. Tools like Zoho Recruit offer free plans that incorporate AI features such as resume parsing and candidate sourcing without requiring a premium subscription. By automating these tasks, recruiters can focus on building relationships with candidates.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">2. Leverage LinkedIn for Candidate Sourcing</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">LinkedIn is an invaluable resource for sourcing top talent. Use its advanced search features to filter candidates based on skills, location, experience, and more. Engage with potential candidates by commenting on their posts or sending personalized connection requests. You can also join industry-specific groups to expand your network and reach passive candidates who may not be actively looking for new opportunities.</p>

      <div className="bg-synapse-lighter/30 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">3. Utilize Free Recruitment Tools</h4>
        <p className="mb-3">Several free recruitment tools can complement your efforts on LinkedIn:</p>

        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-synapse-dark mb-3">4. Analyze Data for Better Decision-Making</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">Utilize data analytics to assess the effectiveness of your recruitment strategies. Track metrics such as time-to-fill, source of hire, and candidate quality to identify areas for improvement. Many free tools offer basic analytics features that can help you make data-driven decisions without needing expensive software.</p>
